Marketplaces may also have specific rules that allow for lower margins based on the liquidity and volatility of the assets being traded.\n\nIn summary, retail margin requirements are generally higher due to increased risk, while marketplace requirements can be lower, reflecting the different risk profiles and trading practices. Always check specific regulations and policies for precise figures.",
