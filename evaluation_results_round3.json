      "base_answer": "If you need to change the price by 10% twice, you will apply the first 10% increase or decrease to the original price, and then apply the second 10% change to the new price. \n\nFor example, if the original price is $100:\n1. First change: $100 + (10% of $100) = $100 + $10 = $110.\n2. Second change: $110 + (10% of $110) = $110 + $11 = $121.\n\nSo, after two 10% increases, the final price would be $121. If you are decreasing the price, the same method applies, but you would subtract instead of add. \n\nAlways ensure that any price changes comply with your company's pricing policy and any relevant regulations.",
      "finetuned_answer": "A cumulative 21% change exceeds the 15% threshold for automatic approval. You should:\n\n1. Document both changes and the cumulative effect.\n2.
